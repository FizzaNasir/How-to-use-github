    <h1>Difference Between git and github</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a 
        development project's source code history</p>
    <p>GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool</p>

    <p>Github is a platform where you can put your code and can mainatain your repository.
        It is every effective to use github when you are working as a team. 
    </p>
    <h1>Github in team effectiveness</h1>
    <p>When you are working in a team, the changes made in the file by one member can be accessed to other members as well just by using 1 command(will be described next)</p>
    <h1>Git commands</h1>
    <h2>git clone</h2>
    <p>It is used to clone a remote git repository to your local machine. Once you clone a repository, now any changes you would make in your local machine folder, will reflect in git repo (using commands describe next )</p>
    <h2>git add .</h2>
    <p>It is used to add files to your remote repository which have added or modified</p>
    <h2>git commit -m 'any msg here'</h2>
    <p>Commit saves the changes you made only to the local repository but not to the remote repository. In the message string, you can write the changes you made or the file you added so that everyone could see what have you pushed.</p>
    <h2>git push</h2>
    <p>Your commits are not automatically synchronized to the remote repository â€“ you have to explicitly push the commits you want to share. When you use the push command, you apply your changes to the upstream repository.</p>
